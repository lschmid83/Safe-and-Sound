Kenwood's Performance Series speakers feature innovative designs that produce natural-sounding, lively music while standing up to the test of time.    The KFC-X172 17cm speakers feature mica-injected, fiber-texture woofer cones that reproduce the lower frequencies precisely, with urethane surrounds that shrug off the effects of heat and humdity.    Kenwood's Image Enhancer does a great job of banishing fuzziness in the mids and highs. A specially designed oval ring surrounds each midrange driver and tweeter to prevent reflected interference, resulting in smoother vocals, wider &quot;sweet spot&quot; dispersion, and less distortion.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/dicediceiaudir5vsilverlineprocaripodkit-p-430.html	Dice I-Audi-R5V Silverline Pro car iPod kit	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   The brand new I-Audi-R/5V "Silverline" interactive iPOD interface is designed to create a seamless interconnection between the iPod and the entertainment controls of many 1998-2009 vehicles (Please see Specific Vehicle Application List below). The kit connects through the CD changer port of the factory radio and will charge your iPod on the go, including the 3G iPhone and all newly released iPODs as well. With the introduction of the Silverline integration, DICE continues to advance the features of their integration solutions.   Browsing on the iPod is intuitive and easy with the new I-Audi-R/5V Silverline series interface, because it was designed for content navigation. Unfortunately, car radios do not present such a versatile user interface, and selecting between the 1000s of songs can be difficult. To ease content navigation the Silverline Series now includes a hierarchical filtering. First the contents are narrowed by selecting a Playlist, and then further narrowed by selecting an Artist. If desired, further content filtering can be achieved by selecting an Album. Of course, having Playlists is not a requirement, and users are free to explore music in their own preferred way. Best of all, while browsing for new content, playback of the current selection is not interrupted until an actual selection is made.    Vehicles with steering wheel controls will work well with the iPod interface kit, allowing the driver to change tracks and in some cases Rewind and Fast Forward. Having not only the ultimate experience for iPod vehicle integration, it also features an auxiliary input jack making a portable satellite radio or DVD player connection simple. The new interface supports all the latest iPod models including the new Classic, nano and the iPod touch.    Comes complete with all cables and connectors necessary to connect this iPOD interface to your factory radio, and to connect your iPOD to this interface. For the auxiliary input on this device, see "Additional Add-on Items", shown below, for any additional cables or connectors you might need to connect your specific audio device to the 3.5mm earphone-type connector on this interface.

That’s right, put 1,000 watts under a seat, instead of filling up the boot. The controls on the front are still accessible.   Compact enough for under-seat installation.    Convenient controls and terminals make installation easy. Put the mono amp under one seat and a fullrange amp under the other seat to hide away the entire amplifier system.   Low Resistance, High Current Speaker Terminals    When you disconnect an amp it is hard to connect again because you don’t know the polarization, but the PDX amps eliminate that problem. You just plug the speaker cables into the terminals you can’t do anything wrong.   Error-free connections.   Much faster and easier.   Convenient installation with pre-wired connectors  Small Footprint    About 60% smaller than previous models with same power output. Makes it possible to build a serious sound system with powerful bass without filling up the boot!!   Same Power Output into 2Ohm and 4Ohm    The ability to provide the same output to 2Ohm and 4Ohm provides greater system building flexibility.   Mono amp has two subwoofer connectors, making it easy to add a second subwoofer.   Same amount of power used to drive one 4Ohm speaker can drive two 4Ohm speakers when they are wired in parallel to create a 2Ohm load.   Efficient way to get more dynamic bass.   Full Range Class-D Amplification    Class-D amplification provides extremely high efficiency, with power losses much lower than with other types of operation. The PDX amps set new benchmarks for performance and accuracy. They use an advanced power supply, custom DSP processor and a true digital Class-D circuit for superior power production and efficient operation.   Excellent Sound Quality    In the PDX-4.150 and PDX-2.150, Alpine met the challenge of producing a full range digital amplifier to rival the sound quality of even the best high-end Class A/B amplifiers. They use improved feedback circuitry to faithfully reproduce the input signal for improved dynamic range and higher fidelity. A revolutionary power supply filtering system, lower switching frequencies and lower output impedance combine to create extremely low distortion and greater speaker control, for clarity that meets or exceeds that found in the best Class   A/B amplifiers. All three amps benefit from the use of trickle down technology from the AlpineF#1Status amplifier.   Layered Installation    All of the new PDX series amplifiers share an identical form. Using the removable 1" diameter trim caps from the top of the amplifiers, the amplifiers can be vertically stacked on top of each other and share one set of mounting holes an industry-first installation option.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/dicediceihondar35silverlineproipodcarkit-p-477.html	Dice I-Honda-R3/5 Silverline Pro iPod car kit	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   The brand new I-Honda-R3/5V "Silverline" interactive iPOD interface is designed to create a seamless interconnection between the iPod and the entertainment controls of many 1998-2009 vehicles (Please see Specific Vehicle Application List below). The kit connects through the CD changer port of the factory radio and will charge your iPod on the go, including the 3G iPhone and all newly released iPODs as well. With the introduction of the Silverline integration, DICE continues to advance the features of their integration solutions.   Browsing on the iPod is intuitive and easy with the new I-Honda-R3/5V Silverline series interface, because it was designed for content navigation. Unfortunately, car radios do not present such a versatile user interface, and selecting between the 1000s of songs can be difficult. To ease content navigation the Silverline Series now includes a hierarchical filtering. First the contents are narrowed by selecting a Playlist, and then further narrowed by selecting an Artist. If desired, further content filtering can be achieved by selecting an Album. Of course, having Playlists is not a requirement, and users are free to explore music in their own preferred way. Best of all, while browsing for new content, playback of the current selection is not interrupted until an actual selection is made.    Vehicles with steering wheel controls will work well with the iPod interface kit, allowing the driver to change tracks and in some cases Rewind and Fast Forward. Having not only the ultimate experience for iPod vehicle integration, it also features an auxiliary input jack making a portable DAB radio or DVD player connection simple. The new interface supports all the latest iPod models including the new Classic, nano and the iPod touch.    Comes complete with all cables and connectors necessary to connect this iPOD interface to your factory radio, and to connect your iPOD to this interface. For the auxiliary input on this device, see "Additional Add-on Items", shown below, for any additional cables or connectors you might need to connect your specific audio device to the 3.5mm earphone-type connector on this interface.   Features   Please note:    Radio MUST support external CD Changer or SAT.  External CD Changer MUST be disconnected if present.  Text available only in SAT mode - Factory XM must be disconnected.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/dicediceibmwt5vsilverlineproipodcarkit-p-550.html	Dice I-BMW-T/5V Silverline Pro ipod car kit	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   The brand new I-BMW-T/5V "Silverline" interactive iPOD interface is designed to create a seamless interconnection between the iPod and the entertainment controls of many 1998-2009 vehicles (Please see Specific Vehicle Application List below). The kit connects through the CD changer port of the factory radio and will charge your iPod on the go, including the 3G iPhone and all newly released iPODs as well. With the introduction of the Silverline integration, DICE continues to advance the features of their integration solutions.   Browsing on the iPod is intuitive and easy with the new I-BMW-T/5V Silverline series interface, because it was designed for content navigation. Unfortunately, car radios do not present such a versatile user interface, and selecting between the 1000s of songs can be difficult. To ease content navigation the Silverline Series now includes a hierarchical filtering. First the contents are narrowed by selecting a Playlist, and then further narrowed by selecting an Artist. If desired, further content filtering can be achieved by selecting an Album. Of course, having Playlists is not a requirement, and users are free to explore music in their own preferred way. Best of all, while browsing for new content, playback of the current selection is not interrupted until an actual selection is made.    Vehicles with steering wheel controls will work well with the iPod interface kit, allowing the driver to change tracks and in some cases Rewind and Fast Forward. Having not only the ultimate experience for iPod vehicle integration, it also features an auxiliary input jack making a portable DAB radio or DVD player connection simple. The new interface supports all the latest iPod models including the new Classic, nano and the iPod touch.    Comes complete with all cables and connectors necessary to connect this iPOD interface to your factory radio, and to connect your iPOD to this interface. For the auxiliary input on this device, see "Additional Add-on Items", shown below, for any additional cables or connectors you might need to connect your specific audio device to the 3.5mm earphone-type connector on this interface.

The cloc+d is a high performance line output converter that features a high voltage (10 volts rms) output and an extremely low source impedance (30 ohms), usually found in only the most expensive aftermarket units.    The cloc+d has a signal sense feature that detects signal on the input and turns the unit on without the need of a 12-volt trigger at the remote in (turn on) connection. Whether you are using the remote in or the signal sense function the cloc+d has a remote out trigger that will turn on your amplifiers or other devices.   The cloc+d has another useful function. It is also a high voltage line driver. If you are using an aftermarket source unit that has a low voltage preamp the cloc+d will boost that voltage up to 10 volts rms of clean signal. With all this, the cloc+d is still small enough to fit just about anywhere.  Features   Max Input Voltage - 20 Volts  Max Output Voltage - 10 Volts  THD - 0.01%  Imput Impedance - > 20K ohms  Output Impedance -  87dB  Signal Sense Level - DC Sense  Dimensions - 3 7/16" x 2 5/16" x 1 1/8"   Support   Instruction Manual   More Images   	2010-01-05	59.99	http://www.safensound.co.uk/catalog/images/cached_cat.JPG	Processors	551 	 new

Components deliver realistic sound with outstanding imaging in the car, making them the choice of serious audio enthusiasts.  Separate woofers and tweeters    Most factory-installed and brand-name car speakers contain two elements, combining a woofer and tweeter into one speaker (also called a "coaxial speaker"). It's a convenient way to get great sound from a single speaker opening, but the design of the woofer and tweeter are both compromised in this arrangement. Also, a tweeter mounted on top of the woofer cone will always, to some degree, interfere with the sound waves produced by the woofer.  With a component speaker system, the woofers and tweeters are mounted independently — each component can operate to its full potential, eliminating the problem of the tweeter impeding woofer performance. More important, independent tweeters can be positioned for optimum imaging and soundstaging.   Manufacturers will often use better materials in separate components than in their 2- or 3-way counterparts. When properly powered, component speakers deliver exceptional dynamics and detail.  External crossovers    A component system usually includes externally-mounted passive crossover networks, designed to complement the woofers and tweeters in the system. These networks of filters direct specific frequency ranges to the woofer and tweeter, so they don't strain to reproduce notes out of their intended range. High-quality crossovers allow you to adjust the relative volume of the tweeter, so the system produces natural, realistic sound.

Unfortunately, it's not always easy to replace your factory stereo, especially if it's tied into climate controls or other critical features. Rockford Fosgate's innovative 3Sixty.1 lets you install premium amplifiers, speakers, and subwoofers without forcing you to replace your factory in-dash stereo or undertake a massive rewiring project.   The 3Sixty.1 offers six high-level and low-level inputs, plus six preamp outputs, so you can use it with anything from a simple, four-speaker setup to a high-end factory 5.1 surround-sound system. You retain use of the in-dash stereo, along with steering-wheel controls or any other special factory equipment in your car. The 3Sixty.1 also features an auxiliary input, so you can add extra sources like your iPod to the mix.   Upgrading the sound of your factory stereo:    You hook up the 3Sixty.1 by connecting your car's speaker wires to its high-level inputs, and your amps to the 5-volt preamp outputs. You'll also need to make power and ground connections.   Sound adjustments are made with a wireless Bluetooth connection. You'll need a laptop computer running Windows or a Windows CE  or Palm device (sold separately). The package includes the software, which lets you adjust the sound wirelessly from anywhere in the car. This lets you mount the 3Sixty.1 in any convenient, out-of-the-way spot.   The 3Sixty.1 initially sets a flat equalization curve, which eliminates preset tone curves that can sound terrible through external amps. You can then tweak the adjustable 15-band equalizer to compensate for deficiencies in your factory stereo's sound processing and the acoustics in your vehicle. When you're done, you'll be able to see a before-and-after comparison of your system's sound quality on your Palm device. A handy dash-mountable source selector and volume knob round out this impressive package.   Brand-name stereos, too:    Of course, it's not just factory stereos that can benefit from the 3Sixty.1 — you can also use it with a brand-name aftermarket stereo. It allows you to add an auxiliary input and more amps than your stereo would normally be able to handle. Features   Interactive signal processor lets you expand and tune any stereo system  Windows System with Bluetooth capability required for making system adjustments  Six high-level speaker inputs (front, rear, subwoofer, and center channel)  Six low-level preamp inputs (front, rear, subwoofer, and center channel)  Six 5-volt preamp outputs (front, rear, subwoofer, and center channel)   Adjustable 15-band equalizer  Auxiliary input  Subwoofer low-pass filter  Automatic equalization of factory sound  Auto sum capability compensates for deficiencies in factory sound  On-board digital signal processor  Dash-mountable volume knob and source selector  Displays before-and-after comparison of sound equalization  7-5/16"W x 1-3/4"H x 4-1/2"D  Support   Instruction Manual   More Images   	2010-01-05	269.99	http://www.safensound.co.uk/catalog/images/3SIXTY1.jpg	Processors	616 	 new

http://www.safensound.co.uk/dynamatdynamatdynaplate-p-866.html	Dynamat Dynaplate	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   Dynaplate is an exotic constrained layer damping material that structurally reinforces car body panels for maximum Sound Pressure Level (SPL). This damping material was specifically engineered for the SPL rules and power classes of dB Dragracing, USACi, IASCA and IdBL. Using a setup of only two layers yields non-flexible panels that prevent the ballooning effect common in SPL vehicles. This Dynaplate setup also reduces vibration better than any other product on the market. What you get is the most bass possible without modifying the appearance of your vehicle’s interior.    Dynaplate is the only damping material specifically designed for SPL competitions. Used in a multiple layer setup, Dynaplate flexes less than standard car sheet metal. At only one quarter the weight, one layer of Dynaplate damps 50% better than Dynamat Original. Two layers produce damping comparable to Dynamat Xtreme and weigh less. Dynaplate is designed for maximum SPL. For sound quality applications use Dynamat Xtreme or a combination of Dynamat Xtreme and Dynaplate.    Contains three 24" x 30" pieces of Dynaplate for floors, roofs, doors, woofer enclosure faces, and anywhere desired to structurally reinforce your vehicle's body panels.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/densiondensiongateway500ipodcontroller-p-1194.html	Dension Gateway 500 iPod Controller	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   The Dension Gateway 500, Dension's master Piece of In Car Entertainment. The Dension Gateway 500 is a special piece of engineering that really highlights how much vehicle development and in car entertainment systems have improved over the past decade.    The Gateway 500 is designed to work with fibre optic systems now available in the majority of vehicles. Unlike normal wiring, firbe optics sends light signals through thin glass fibres spanning the vehicle monitoring all car systems (not only entertainment), this increases the performance and allows for future enhancements of the factory systems. However due to this normal kits are not compatible with any vehicle that has D2B or MOST fibre optic systems.   Although the Dension Gateway 500 is designed primarly for the iPod, a large number of other devices are compatible with the system. USB memory sticks and Mass storage devices can be connected via the USB input & any device with an AUX output can also be attached. Although it is the iPod compatibility that really sets the Dension Gateway 500 aside from the others. When connected the iPod functions are accessable safely through your vehicle steering controls and your music and video library can be accessed and played in perfect quality through the factory system.   One of the best features of the Gateway 500 is the ability to upgrade the system in the form of "addons" or additional devices that allow the system to perform specific tasks. The BTA1500 bluetooth adapter allows you to make use of your phone whilst driving, auto muting the music system when the phone is in use. Another useful addon is the AVR, the AVR will allow videos stored on you iPod or USB device to be played on factory fitted screens (in the headrest for example). The greatest feature on the AVR is that it is capable of playing media from multisource's. So you might want to listen to your iPod in the front whist the kids watch they're favourite movie in the back.    The Dension Gateway 500 is provided with all the necessary equipment to connect to the standard MOST fibre optic systems.    This break through by Dension is one of many on the way in the coming years that will allow you to integrate many other systems and devices into your vehicle seamlessly to make sure you stay ahead of the technology curve.

The Dension Gateway 500 is a special piece of engineering that really highlights how much vehicle development and in car entertainment systems have improved over the past decade.    The Gateway 500 is designed to work with fibre optic systems now available in the majority of vehicles. Unlike normal wiring, firbe optics sends light signals through thin glass fibres spanning the vehicle monitoring all car systems (not only entertainment), this increases the performance and allows for future enhancements of the factory systems. However due to this normal kits are not compatible with any vehicle that has D2B or MOST fibre optic systems.   Although the Dension Gateway 500 is designed primarly for the iPod, a large number of other devices are compatible with the system. USB memory sticks and Mass storage devices can be connected via the USB input & any device with an AUX output can also be attached. Although it is the iPod compatibility that really sets the Dension Gateway 500 aside from the others. When connected the iPod functions are accessable safely through your vehicle steering controls and your music and video library can be accessed and played in perfect quality through the factory system.   One of the best features of the Gateway 500 is the ability to upgrade the system in the form of "addons" or additional devices that allow the system to perform specific tasks. The BTA1500 bluetooth adapter allows you to make use of your phone whilst driving, auto muting the music system when the phone is in use. Another useful addon is the AVR, the AVR will allow videos stored on you iPod or USB device to be played on factory fitted screens (in the headrest for example). The greatest feature on the AVR is that it is capable of playing media from multisource's. So you might want to listen to your iPod in the front whist the kids watch they're favourite movie in the back.    The Dension Gateway 500 is provided with all the necessary equipment to connect to the standard MOST fibre optic systems.    This break through by Dension is one of many on the way in the coming years that will allow you to integrate many other systems and devices into your vehicle seamlessly to make sure you stay ahead of the technology curve.

When space is limited (like in stealthy custom installations or behind the seats of a truck or sports car), achieving excellent low frequency performance becomes far more challenging.   One way to deal with this is to use small subwoofer drivers, like JL Audio's 6.5-inch or 8-inch models, but if the goal is higher output bass than the small drivers can comfortably deliver, a more potent solution is needed.   This is precisely where the new 13TW5 subwoofers slot into the JL Audio lineup, offering groundbreaking performance in the tightest space applications. The patented thin-line woofer technology compresses the architecture of the woofer to make it all happen.   To counteract the efficiency tradeoff of small box volumes, the JL Audio 13TW5's are designed to handle very high power levels thanks to the use of very large voice coils.   So, if you're looking for premium subwoofer performance in the tightest spaces, you have not only found the shallowest automotive subwoofers on the market, but also the most capable.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/jlaudiojlaudiocleansweepcl441dspoeminterface-p-1286.html	JL Audio CleanSweep CL441dsp OEM Interface	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   You can keep the look and functionality of your factory stereo, and still get outstanding audiophile sound with JL Audio's CleanSweep sound processor. It connects to your factory stereo's speaker lines and cleans up the stereo's output by sweeping away any processing from the stereo that could diminish the sound quality.    Many factory stereos use built-in equalization designed to make cheap factory speakers sound better, but this dressed-up signal can prevent aftermarket speakers from living up to their potential. The CleanSweep uses a 32-bit digital signal processor to remove the factory adjustments, then sends your external amplifiers a perfectly clean signal.    The CleanSweep connects to your factory radio's speaker wires, then takes the output of your factory radio and eliminates the peaks and valleys of the preset equalization, leaving a pure, unadulterated signal for your aftermarket amplifiers, speakers, and subs to work with. Your music will spring to life, with resonant lows, sparkling highs, and a realistic sense of depth and presence.    A simple solution and simple setup    Since the CleanSweep attaches to the speaker wire outputs of your factory radio, it doesn't interfere with any factory radio functions like OnStar or hands-free calling. Use the two sets of preamp outputs to connect your new amplifiers, and build your system from there. Best of all, you can take the CleanSweep with you when you purchase or lease a new vehicle.    The CleanSweep is simple to use. Once you've connected it, pop the included CD into your stereo, and the CleanSweep corrects the equalization in as little as 20 seconds. You don't have to adjust anything — the CleanSweep utilizes its built-in 120-band digital equalizer automatically, without the need for external control devices. The equalizer settings are saved in the CleanSweep's memory, even if you disconnect the car battery.    Adds an auxiliary input    The CleanSweep not only improves your sound, it adds extra functionality to your system. The built-in auxiliary input lets you connect an extra source, like an iPod or a plug-and-play satellite radio to your system, and enjoy the superior sound quality of a direct audio connection. A remote-mount volume knob lets you adjust system volume and select your auxiliary source. If you choose, you can still use the factory radio's volume, treble, and bass controls as well.    Accessories    The optional CL-SES source switch lets you expand the CleanSweep to accommodate up to three auxiliary sources. Some factory systems use more than four output channels — the optional CL-SSI Signal Summing Interface will merge the signals so they can be processed by the CleanSweep.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/jlaudiojlaudioclssisignalsumminginterface-p-1287.html	JL Audio CL-SSI Signal Summing Interface	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   The JL Audio CL-SSI signal summing interface lets you use the CL441dsp CleanSweep when you have a factory-installed "premium" sound system that doesn't send full-range signals to all of its speakers.    The CL-SSI combines the bass, midrange, and high-frequency outputs from your premium factory system, and presents a full-range stereo signal to the CleanSweep. The CleanSweep then removes the factory-set equalization from the signal before it travels to your aftermarket amplifiers, speakers, and subwoofers, so you get the best possible sound quality.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/jlaudiojlaudioclrlcremotelevelcontrollinedriver-p-1289.html	JL Audio CL-RLC Remote Level Control / Line Driver	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   The CL-RLC is a true, active level control preamplifier which can be used for subwoofer level control or as an audiophile-grade, full-range volume control. The CL-RLC's differential-balanced inputs minimize the likelihood of noise, while its very healthy preamp design delivers up to 7.5 VRMS of unclipped output to your amplifier. Unlike cheap, passive line-level controls, no signal passes through the CL-RLC's control cable and knob. Instead, the control knob only sends volume level signals to the preamp circuit in order to maximize fidelity and minimize the possibility of noise.    Subwoofer Level    By inserting the CL-RLC in-line with any signal feeding a subwoofer amplifier you can control the subwoofer level from the front of the vehicle using the supplied control knob. Unlike the RBC-1, which is an EQ boost controller, this is a true level control for the subwoofer amplifier. Another important feature is a buffered pass-through connection so that you can also pass signal along (without volume control) to a satellite amplifier from the same input channels.   Full-Range Volume Control    Since the CL-RLC uses top-quality active circuitry, its application is not just limited to subwoofer duty. It can be used whenever and wherever you want to have volume control over any line-level signal. For example, you can use it to control a center-channel level, rear channel levels, or even the level of an iPod input directly to an amplifier. The possibilities are endless and will enable very interesting things to be accomplished in a wide variety of systems.

Home audio speakers typically come in well crafted, heavy boxes to eliminate this distortion - a solution that is impossible (or at least impractical) in your car. For your car, Dynamat is the solution. Applying Dynamat to the panels surrounding your speakers eliminates speaker panel distortion by transforming the flimsy sheet metal into a solid non-resonant baffle. Dynamat improves mid-bass performance and stops vibration rattles and squeaks. Your stereo will sound its very best with Dynamat.   The Xtreme Wedge Kit controls vibration four times better than Dynamat Original and requires no heat for installation, which makes Dynamat Xtreme a great choice for do-it-yourselfers.    The Wedge Kit contains one 18" x 32" piece of Dynamat Xtreme for general use on rear decks, doors, floors and the trunk floors. Dynamat Xtreme is also recommended for trunk lids, roofs, quarter panels and under-hood installations. Self-adhesive.

The difference in size only effects the way the facia itself fits to the head unit cage. For example, if the aftermarket facia adaptor available for a particular vehicle is 113mm (known as 2 x Din) then the installer will require a 113mm cage in order to fit. This size cage is supplied with the main branded Alpine, Kenwood or Pioneer stereos.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/kickerkickersolobaric15l7dual2ohmsubwoofer-p-1476.html	Kicker Solobaric 15" L7 dual 2 Ohm Subwoofer	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   In 2008 the newest KICKER Solo-Baric L7 Subwoofer remains the most capable subwoofer on Earth. Without question, it’s the best-looking, best-sounding square subwoofer available. And it’s the only patented one that provides more cone, more air, and more decibels.    KICKER engineers left it all on the table for this redesigned Solo-Baric L7, taking cues from the award-winning original that debuted as groundbreaking at the turn of the millennium, and then improving on them. Let there be no doubt, it’s the most complete KICKER subwoofer ever developed.    Available in 8-, 10-, 12-, and 15-inch models, the Solo-Baric L7 still revolves around the breakthrough SoloKon, the one-piece, injection-molded cone with full-coverage back bracing that pushes more air and creates louder bass than any like-size round subwoofer. It’s good enough that KICKER uses SoloKon across the board as the cornerstone for each subwoofer in the KICKER bass-making family.    SoloKon may be a rock star, but it’s the unshakeable motor structure behind the scenes that propels it to the forefront. Minor tweaks have given the motor an outstanding rep – dual high-temp voice coils, poly-cotton semi-progressive spider, Spiralead tinsel-lead technology, highly-efficient UniPlate pole-piece/back plate, and a heat-reducing T-cut top plate for enormous power handling. And it’s never been cooler with a new solid pole piece that disperses more heat than ever before, and more venting near the SoloKon back brace and spider landing.    The distinctive cast-aluminum basket with spring-loaded terminals wraps around and protects these specialized inner workings, with the Solo-Baric crest branded into the back plate.    The Solo-Baric L7 remains available in 2-Ohm or 4-Ohm DVC and conducts business from a sealed or vented box application.

http://www.safensound.co.uk/kickerkickersolobaric15l7dual4ohmsubwoofer-p-1477.html	Kicker Solobaric 15" L7 dual 4 Ohm Subwoofer	 <b>Free UK Mainland Delivery</b>   In 2008 the newest KICKER Solo-Baric L7 Subwoofer remains the most capable subwoofer on Earth. Without question, it’s the best-looking, best-sounding square subwoofer available. And it’s the only patented one that provides more cone, more air, and more decibels.    KICKER engineers left it all on the table for this redesigned Solo-Baric L7, taking cues from the award-winning original that debuted as groundbreaking at the turn of the millennium, and then improving on them. Let there be no doubt, it’s the most complete KICKER subwoofer ever developed.    Available in 8-, 10-, 12-, and 15-inch models, the Solo-Baric L7 still revolves around the breakthrough SoloKon, the one-piece, injection-molded cone with full-coverage back bracing that pushes more air and creates louder bass than any like-size round subwoofer. It’s good enough that KICKER uses SoloKon across the board as the cornerstone for each subwoofer in the KICKER bass-making family.    SoloKon may be a rock star, but it’s the unshakeable motor structure behind the scenes that propels it to the forefront. Minor tweaks have given the motor an outstanding rep – dual high-temp voice coils, poly-cotton semi-progressive spider, Spiralead tinsel-lead technology, highly-efficient UniPlate pole-piece/back plate, and a heat-reducing T-cut top plate for enormous power handling. And it’s never been cooler with a new solid pole piece that disperses more heat than ever before, and more venting near the SoloKon back brace and spider landing.    The distinctive cast-aluminum basket with spring-loaded terminals wraps around and protects these specialized inner workings, with the Solo-Baric crest branded into the back plate.    The Solo-Baric L7 remains available in 2-Ohm or 4-Ohm DVC and conducts business from a sealed or vented box application.

If you have any questions or need assistance please call us on  0208 2880181  or email us at info@safensound.co.uk  Features   As no industry standard has been set, aftermarket Double Din facia adaptors are manufactured in 2 different size heights (130mm and 113mm) and both are designed for the fitting of standard Double Din head units.    The difference in size only effects the way the facia itself fits to the head unit cage. For example, if the aftermarket facia adaptor available for a particular vehicle is 113mm (known as 2 x Din) then the installer will require a 113mm cage in order to fit, This size cage is supplied with the main branded Alpine, Kenwood or Pioneer stereos. However sometimes the space in the vehicle to fit a double size head unit isn't big enough, such as some of the vauxhall vehicles. This is where this kit with a 103mm cage and trim plate comes into play.   The important thing to remember is the height of the main brand double din stereos without their supplied cage is 103mm but they supply you with 113mm cage. Which is very clever because if the stereo was 113mm it wouldn't fit into some of the most popular vehicles.
