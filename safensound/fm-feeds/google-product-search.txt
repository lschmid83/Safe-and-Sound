The kit connects through the CD changer port of the factory radio and will charge your iPod on the go, including the 3G iPhone and all newly released iPODs as well. With the introduction of the Silverline integration, DICE continues to advance the features of their integration solutions. Browsing on the iPod is intuitive and easy with the new I-Audi-R/5V Silverline series interface, because it was designed for content navigation. Unfortunately, car radios do not present such a versatile user interface, and selecting between the 1000s of songs can be difficult. To ease content navigation the Silverline Series now includes a hierarchical filtering. First the contents are narrowed by selecting a Playlist, and then further narrowed by selecting an Artist. If desired, further content filtering can be achieved by selecting an Album. Of course, having Playlists is not a requirement, and users are free to explore music in their own preferred way. Best of all, while browsing for new content, playback of the current selection is not interrupted until an actual selection is made. Vehicles with steering wheel controls will work well with the iPod interface kit, allowing the driver to change tracks and in some cases Rewind and Fast Forward. Having not only the ultimate experience for iPod vehicle integration, it also features an auxiliary input jack making a portable satellite radio or DVD player connection simple. The new interface supports all the latest iPod models including the new Classic, nano and the iPod touch. Comes complete with all cables and connectors necessary to connect this iPOD interface to your factory radio, and to connect your iPOD to this interface. For the auxiliary input on this device, see &quot;Additional Add-on Items&quot;, shown below, for any additional cables or connectors you might need to connect your specific audio device to the 3.5mm earphone-type connector on this interface.     Features Suitable For:  2006-2009 A3 1998-2008 A4/S4 1998-2004 A6 1998-2001 A8 1998-2004 S6/R6 1998-2001 S8 2000-2005 Allroad 2000-2006 TT 2008-2009 TT      Support      More Images

The kit connects through the CD changer port of the factory radio and will charge your iPod on the go, including the 3G iPhone and all newly released iPODs as well. With the introduction of the Silverline integration, DICE continues to advance the features of their integration solutions. Browsing on the iPod is intuitive and easy with the new I-Honda-R3/5V Silverline series interface, because it was designed for content navigation. Unfortunately, car radios do not present such a versatile user interface, and selecting between the 1000s of songs can be difficult. To ease content navigation the Silverline Series now includes a hierarchical filtering. First the contents are narrowed by selecting a Playlist, and then further narrowed by selecting an Artist. If desired, further content filtering can be achieved by selecting an Album. Of course, having Playlists is not a requirement, and users are free to explore music in their own preferred way. Best of all, while browsing for new content, playback of the current selection is not interrupted until an actual selection is made. Vehicles with steering wheel controls will work well with the iPod interface kit, allowing the driver to change tracks and in some cases Rewind and Fast Forward. Having not only the ultimate experience for iPod vehicle integration, it also features an auxiliary input jack making a portable DAB radio or DVD player connection simple. The new interface supports all the latest iPod models including the new Classic, nano and the iPod touch. Comes complete with all cables and connectors necessary to connect this iPOD interface to your factory radio, and to connect your iPOD to this interface. For the auxiliary input on this device, see &quot;Additional Add-on Items&quot;, shown below, for any additional cables or connectors you might need to connect your specific audio device to the 3.5mm earphone-type connector on this interface.     Features Please note: Radio MUST support external CD Changer or SAT.  External CD Changer MUST be disconnected if present. Text available only in SAT mode - Factory XM must be disconnected.  Suitable For:  2003-2009 Accord 2006-2009 Civic 2005-2009 CRV 2006-2009 Fit 2000-2003 Insight 2005-2009 Odyssey 2006-2009 Pilot 2004-2009 S2000      Support      More Images

The kit connects through the CD changer port of the factory radio and will charge your iPod on the go, including the 3G iPhone and all newly released iPODs as well. With the introduction of the Silverline integration, DICE continues to advance the features of their integration solutions. Browsing on the iPod is intuitive and easy with the new I-BMW-T/5V Silverline series interface, because it was designed for content navigation. Unfortunately, car radios do not present such a versatile user interface, and selecting between the 1000s of songs can be difficult. To ease content navigation the Silverline Series now includes a hierarchical filtering. First the contents are narrowed by selecting a Playlist, and then further narrowed by selecting an Artist. If desired, further content filtering can be achieved by selecting an Album. Of course, having Playlists is not a requirement, and users are free to explore music in their own preferred way. Best of all, while browsing for new content, playback of the current selection is not interrupted until an actual selection is made. Vehicles with steering wheel controls will work well with the iPod interface kit, allowing the driver to change tracks and in some cases Rewind and Fast Forward. Having not only the ultimate experience for iPod vehicle integration, it also features an auxiliary input jack making a portable DAB radio or DVD player connection simple. The new interface supports all the latest iPod models including the new Classic, nano and the iPod touch. Comes complete with all cables and connectors necessary to connect this iPOD interface to your factory radio, and to connect your iPOD to this interface. For the auxiliary input on this device, see &quot;Additional Add-on Items&quot;, shown below, for any additional cables or connectors you might need to connect your specific audio device to the 3.5mm earphone-type connector on this interface.

Components deliver realistic sound with outstanding imaging in the car, making them the choice of serious audio enthusiasts. Separate woofers and tweeters Most factory-installed and brand-name car speakers contain two elements, combining a woofer and tweeter into one speaker (also called a &quot;coaxial speaker&quot;). It's a convenient way to get great sound from a single speaker opening, but the design of the woofer and tweeter are both compromised in this arrangement. Also, a tweeter mounted on top of the woofer cone will always, to some degree, interfere with the sound waves produced by the woofer. With a component speaker system, the woofers and tweeters are mounted independently  each component can operate to its full potential, eliminating the problem of the tweeter impeding woofer performance. More important, independent tweeters can be positioned for optimum imaging and soundstaging. Manufacturers will often use better materials in separate components than in their 2- or 3-way counterparts. When properly powered, component speakers deliver exceptional dynamics and detail. External crossovers A component system usually includes externally-mounted passive crossover networks, designed to complement the woofers and tweeters in the system. These networks of filters direct specific frequency ranges to the woofer and tweeter, so they don't strain to reproduce notes out of their intended range. High-quality crossovers allow you to adjust the relative volume of the tweeter, so the system produces natural, realistic sound.     More Images

This damping material was specifically engineered for the SPL rules and power classes of dB Dragracing, USACi, IASCA and IdBL. Using a setup of only two layers yields non-flexible panels that prevent the ballooning effect common in SPL vehicles. This Dynaplate setup also reduces vibration better than any other product on the market. What you get is the most bass possible without modifying the appearance of your vehicles interior. Dynaplate is the only damping material specifically designed for SPL competitions. Used in a multiple layer setup, Dynaplate flexes less than standard car sheet metal. At only one quarter the weight, one layer of Dynaplate damps 50% better than Dynamat Original. Two layers produce damping comparable to Dynamat Xtreme and weigh less. Dynaplate is designed for maximum SPL. For sound quality applications use Dynamat Xtreme or a combination of Dynamat Xtreme and Dynaplate. Contains three 24&quot; x 30&quot; pieces of Dynaplate for floors, roofs, doors, woofer enclosure faces, and anywhere desired to structurally reinforce your vehicle's body panels.

When space is limited (like in stealthy custom installations or behind the seats of a truck or sports car), achieving excellent low frequency performance becomes far more challenging.  One way to deal with this is to use small subwoofer drivers, like JL Audio's 6.5-inch or 8-inch models, but if the goal is higher output bass than the small drivers can comfortably deliver, a more potent solution is needed. This is precisely where the new 13TW5 subwoofers slot into the JL Audio lineup, offering groundbreaking performance in the tightest space applications. The patented thin-line woofer technology compresses the architecture of the woofer to make it all happen. To counteract the efficiency tradeoff of small box volumes, the JL Audio 13TW5's are designed to handle very high power levels thanks to the use of very large voice coils. So, if you're looking for premium subwoofer performance in the tightest spaces, you have not only found the shallowest automotive subwoofers on the market, but also the most capable.

Tunable frequency filters give you precise control over your sound, and a switchable bass boost lets you add a little punch when you're driving a subwoofer. The optional RBC-1 remote converts the bass boost into a fully variable control that you can adjust from the comfort of your front seat.

It connects to your factory stereo's speaker lines and cleans up the stereo's output by sweeping away any processing from the stereo that could diminish the sound quality.  Many factory stereos use built-in equalization designed to make cheap factory speakers sound better, but this dressed-up signal can prevent aftermarket speakers from living up to their potential. The CleanSweep uses a 32-bit digital signal processor to remove the factory adjustments, then sends your external amplifiers a perfectly clean signal. The CleanSweep connects to your factory radio's speaker wires, then takes the output of your factory radio and eliminates the peaks and valleys of the preset equalization, leaving a pure, unadulterated signal for your aftermarket amplifiers, speakers, and subs to work with. Your music will spring to life, with resonant lows, sparkling highs, and a realistic sense of depth and presence. A simple solution and simple setup Since the CleanSweep attaches to the speaker wire outputs of your factory radio, it doesn't interfere with any factory radio functions like OnStar&reg; or hands-free calling. Use the two sets of preamp outputs to connect your new amplifiers, and build your system from there. Best of all, you can take the CleanSweep with you when you purchase or lease a new vehicle. The CleanSweep is simple to use. Once you've connected it, pop the included CD into your stereo, and the CleanSweep corrects the equalization in as little as 20 seconds. You don't have to adjust anything  the CleanSweep utilizes its built-in 120-band digital equalizer automatically, without the need for external control devices. The equalizer settings are saved in the CleanSweep's memory, even if you disconnect the car battery. Adds an auxiliary input The CleanSweep not only improves your sound, it adds extra functionality to your system. The built-in auxiliary input lets you connect an extra source, like an iPod&reg; or a plug-and-play satellite radio to your system, and enjoy the superior sound quality of a direct audio connection. A remote-mount volume knob lets you adjust system volume and select your auxiliary source. If you choose, you can still use the factory radio's volume, treble, and bass controls as well. Accessories The optional CL-SES source switch lets you expand the CleanSweep to accommodate up to three auxiliary sources. Some factory systems use more than four output channels  the optional CL-SSI Signal Summing Interface will merge the signals so they can be processed by the CleanSweep.

The CL-SSI combines the bass, midrange, and high-frequency outputs from your premium factory system, and presents a full-range stereo signal to the CleanSweep. The CleanSweep then removes the factory-set equalization from the signal before it travels to your aftermarket amplifiers, speakers, and subwoofers, so you get the best possible sound quality.     Features signal-summing interface for use with the CL441dsp CleanSweep combines factory system signals into full-range outputs dimensions: 5-1/16&quot; x 4-3/8&quot; x 1-9/16&quot;     Support Instruction Manual     More Images

This high-quality switcher lets you choose from up to three different input sources with a manually operated switch or through automatic signal sensing.  You can also add this versatile device to almost any system that has an auxiliary input, including most aftermarket in-dash receivers. Once it's installed, you'll enjoy the convenience of choosing your audio source without having to mess around with patch cords or mini-jack cables.

The CL-RLC's differential-balanced inputs minimize the likelihood of noise, while its very healthy preamp design delivers up to 7.5 VRMS of unclipped output to your amplifier. Unlike cheap, passive line-level controls, no signal passes through the CL-RLC's control cable and knob. Instead, the control knob only sends volume level signals to the preamp circuit in order to maximize fidelity and minimize the possibility of noise. Subwoofer Level By inserting the CL-RLC in-line with any signal feeding a subwoofer amplifier you can control the subwoofer level from the front of the vehicle using the supplied control knob. Unlike the RBC-1, which is an EQ boost controller, this is a true level control for the subwoofer amplifier. Another important feature is a buffered pass-through connection so that you can also pass signal along (without volume control) to a satellite amplifier from the same input channels. Full-Range Volume Control Since the CL-RLC uses top-quality active circuitry, its application is not just limited to subwoofer duty. It can be used whenever and wherever you want to have volume control over any line-level signal. For example, you can use it to control a center-channel level, rear channel levels, or even the level of an iPod&reg; input directly to an amplifier. The possibilities are endless and will enable very interesting things to be accomplished in a wide variety of systems.

Weve done it for years, but improving on a trendsetting yet affordable product like the Solo-Baric&reg; L5 Subwoofer is no easy task.  The Solo-Baric L5 inherits all the same patented technology as the dominant L7 square woofer, with a hot new look and improved design for an even mightier performance. The cone and basket take on a more macho feel in 2008. Like its ultimate SoloX Subwoofer big brother, the Solo-Baric L5 utilizes SoloKon technology, a vacuum-formed, ultra-rigid design with vented 360-degree back bracing used to push mass quantities of air.

Weve done it for years, but improving on a trendsetting yet affordable product like the Solo-Baric&reg; L5 Subwoofer is no easy task.  The Solo-Baric L5 inherits all the same patented technology as the dominant L7 square woofer, with a hot new look and improved design for an even mightier performance. The cone and basket take on a more macho feel in 2008. Like its ultimate SoloX Subwoofer big brother, the Solo-Baric L5 utilizes SoloKon technology, a vacuum-formed, ultra-rigid design with vented 360-degree back bracing used to push mass quantities of air. A Santoprene&reg; surround handles the force of the L5s motor and cone, and a rear foam gasket secures the stamped-steel basket to any given baffle. The logo-bearing steel basket with spring-loaded terminals, a stout magnet, and the logo-bearing protective front gasket also allow the L5 to take on any punishment given.  The L5s motor structure also handles extreme power with high-temp dual voice coils covering a new heat-dispersing, solid pole piece, a poly-cotton semi-progressive spider with perimeter venting built into the spider landing, and long-lasting Spiralead tinsel leads. Altogether its a square-sub recipe for delivering superior bass. The four sizes of Solo-Baric L5 are available in 2-Ohm or 4-Ohm DVC and deliver force from sealed- or vented-box applications.

Without question, its the best-looking, best-sounding square subwoofer available. And its the only patented one that provides more cone, more air, and more decibels.  KICKER engineers left it all on the table for this redesigned Solo-Baric L7, taking cues from the award-winning original that debuted as groundbreaking at the turn of the millennium, and then improving on them. Let there be no doubt, its the most complete KICKER subwoofer ever developed. Available in 8-, 10-, 12-, and 15-inch models, the Solo-Baric L7 still revolves around the breakthrough SoloKon, the one-piece, injection-molded cone with full-coverage back bracing that pushes more air and creates louder bass than any like-size round subwoofer. Its good enough that KICKER uses SoloKon across the board as the cornerstone for each subwoofer in the KICKER bass-making family.  SoloKon may be a rock star, but its the unshakeable motor structure behind the scenes that propels it to the forefront. Minor tweaks have given the motor an outstanding rep  dual high-temp voice coils, poly-cotton semi-progressive spider, Spiralead tinsel-lead technology, highly-efficient UniPlate pole-piece/back plate, and a heat-reducing T-cut top plate for enormous power handling. And its never been cooler with a new solid pole piece that disperses more heat than ever before, and more venting near the SoloKon back brace and spider landing. The distinctive cast-aluminum basket with spring-loaded terminals wraps around and protects these specialized inner workings, with the Solo-Baric crest branded into the back plate. The Solo-Baric L7 remains available in 2-Ohm or 4-Ohm DVC and conducts business from a sealed or vented box application.

If you have any questions or need assistance please call us on  0208 2880181  or email us at info@safensound.co.uk      Features As no industry standard has been set, aftermarket Double Din facia adaptors are manufactured in 2 different size heights (130mm and 113mm) and both are designed for the fitting of standard Double Din head units. The difference in size only effects the way the facia itself fits to the head unit cage. For example, if the aftermarket facia adaptor available for a particular vehicle is 113mm (known as 2 x Din) then the installer will require a 113mm cage in order to fit, This size cage is supplied with the main branded Alpine, Kenwood or Pioneer stereos. However sometimes the space in the vehicle to fit a double size head unit isn't big enough, such as some of the vauxhall vehicles. This is where this kit with a 103mm cage and trim plate comes into play. The important thing to remember is the height of the main brand double din stereos without their supplied cage is 103mm but they supply you with 113mm cage. Which is very clever because if the stereo was 113mm it wouldn't fit into some of the most popular vehicles.

1660	Alpine NVE-M300P Navigation Module	399.98	Alpine	NVE-M300P	Headunits Sat Nav built-in	http://www.safensound.co.uk/alpinealpinenvem300pnavigationmodule-p-1660.html?utm_campaign=google-simple&amp;utm_medium=product_search&amp;utm_source=google-simple	http://www.safensound.co.uk/catalog/images/NVE-M300P.jpg	new	Description The NVE-M300P integrates seamlessly with Alpine's Digital Media Stations, allowing touch screen control and providing Navi Mix, so when you're listening to music and a turn comes up, the music is muted and you hear the Voice Guidance announcement hence you don't need an additional speaker. The high-resolution interface is designed with a consistent structure for operation thats so easy, you won't need the manual. Highly visible menus and icons, as well as the clean, uncluttered design, make it a pleasure to use.  Another benefit of the powerful software besides the standard 2D map is 3D Map View, which gives you a more realistic view of the surrounding streets. It also provides hundreds of 3D landmark icons showing easily identifiable places, so you know where you are at a glance and what's around you. When you approach an intersection or motorway exit, the map automatically zooms in to give you a better view. Then when you are past it, it zooms back to a normal view of the road ahead. And thanks to the system's seamless scaling, map reloading is very fast so zooming (both manual and automatic) is super-smooth.  The NVE-M300P is only 110mm wide by 25mm high and 85mm deep. This compact size allows installation in any convenient location (in a horizontal position). To obtain software and map updates in the future there is no need to remove the navigation module. Connect the mini USB cable to the port (5) and leave the other end, the USB connector, to an accecessible location. Connections: 1. GPS antenna, 2. RDS TMC module, 3. RGB monitor head unit / display out, 4. Power cord (harness), 5. Mini USB cable What's more, it does not require many connections to the vehicle's electrical system (only the power connection), so there is no need for locating signals such as speed pulse, reverse gear or parking brake.  Alpine's powerful navigation software provides extremely wide, very detailed map coverage that extends to 43 countries, with voice guidance available in 30 languages. The system offers the convenience of personal POI importing. If you've set personal POIs on free POI database websites, you can put them on a USB stick in KLM format and import them into your navigation system. You'll be able to see your own POIs at a glance, such as favourite petrol stations, coffee shops, and so on. Finally, after your trip is finished, Track Logs lets you export the data to Google Earth to see the route you drove. You can decide whether you want to use that route again or change it, keep your favourite routes, and make note of places you liked along the way such as restaurants and camping areas.  Lane Guidance is an extremely convenient feature that not only shows you the next turn, but also which lane you should be in. You're never in danger of missing a turn on city streets or motorway exits. Text-to-Speech also gives you &quot;extra&quot; information by providing more detailed voice guidance than usual (in 11 languages). It reads the text on the screen, so instead of just announcing &quot;Turn right,&quot; for example, it says &quot;Turn right onto A8, direction Stuttgart.&quot;  Other great features include: route information and route simulation mode, daytime and nighttime colour profiles, road safety cameras preinstalled for various countries where usage is legal, increased map coverage especially for Eastern European countries with the latest maps available, turn-by-turn guidance, and 7-digit UK postcode search.      Features Touch Control Ready Excellent UK &amp; Europe map coverage Includes eastern European countries Includes one free map update after purchase of NVE-M300P 2D and real 3D map display with hundreds of 3D landmark icons User Interface with consistent structure Lane guidance display Personal POI (Point Of Interest) import Built-in TMC tuner with wide European coverage 7 digit UK postcode search Compatible With the following Alpine models: IVA-D106R IVA-W502R IVA-W205R IXA-W407BT IXA-W404R IVA-W505R IVA-W520R IVA-D511R/RB IVA-D105R IVA-D100R/RB TME-S370 TME-M860 IVA-W202R IVA-W200R IVA-D310R/RB IVA-D300R/RB     Support Instruction Manual     More Images

These &quot;Shallow-Mount&quot; Subwoofers feature multiple patent-pending features to deliver the big bass performance of a full-size subwoofer, but in a compact design that can be installed either behind or under seats depending on the type of vehicle. The mounting depth is just 2-1/2&quot; - less than half a typical subwoofer in this class. This 8&quot; shallow subwoofer handles 500 watts max., 120 watts nominal power, and delivers deep bass with top-notch sound quality thanks to features like Pioneer's extremely strong and lightweight IMPP Composite Double Cone Woofer, the patent-pending M-shaped Surround, and more. One of the new patent-pending features is called the &quot;Air Suspension Control System&quot;. This design locks in air between the main cone and drive cone, ensuring smoother and more precise movement of the cones, for superior linearity. The locked-in air behaves like a spring, so there's no need for a traditional spider structure. The drive cone also deflects air pressure inside the enclosure, which further contributes to the remarkable bass of the small package.

Pioneers Class-D amps transform very little power into heat so a higher percentage of the power supply (67 %) is transformed into the load. This results in a very compact amp which needs less input power to produce very high output power. The Class-D amplifiers PWM (Pulse Width Modulator) modulates the original audio input signal with a triangulated signal wave which has a much higher fixed frequency. The result is a digital signal which contains both the input signal and a band of frequency components around the modulation frequency. A LPF (Low Pass Filter) then filters out the high frequency pulses and the resulting amplified output signal is then sent to the subwoofer and/or speakers. Built-In Crossover (40~500Hz Variable Low-Pass or High-Pass): Built into the GM-D9500F is a very smart crossover network. This optimizes your system's efficiency and delivers the best possible sound quality. Speaker Level Inputs: What, you DON'T own a Pioneer headunit? Well, we won't hold it against you. In fact we'll even help you build onto your system. The GM-D9500F's speaker level inputs allow you to connect your OEM unit (or any unit that doesn't have the typical RCA-type inputs) without having to buy add-on adapters. So, the install goes faster, you save money, and you've got a Pioneer amp in your vehicle.     Features Specifications: Peak Music Power: 800 Watts Number of Channels: 4 Load Impedance Capability: 2~8 Ohm Continuous Power (4 ohm): 75W x 4 Continuous Power (2 ohm): 100W x 4 Continuous Power Bridged (4 ohm): 200W x 2 Frequency Response: 10Hz to 35kHz Total Harmonic Distortion: Signal-to-Noise Ratio: &gt;95 dB Dimensions: 8-7/8&quot; x 2-14&quot; x 7-7/8&quot; (225 mm x 56 mm x 200 mm) Features: Bridgeable Channel # Capability: 4/3/2 Class-D Design PWM Regulated MOSFET Power Supply MOSFET Output Section Compression-Type Speaker Terminals Balanced Isolator Input Circuit RCA Inputs: 4 Channel RCA Outputs (Pass Thru) Speaker Level Input: Yes Input Level Control: Hi-Volt (200mV ~ 6.5v) Built-in Crossover: 4-Ch.

IMPRINT Sound is a stunning new suite of sound processing technologies that let you sit in the producer's chair and hear music exactly as it was meant to be heard. It delivers sonic accuracy never before available in the car, and utilises sophisticated professional sound tuning technologies, including MultEQ, that measure your car's acoustics and process the sound  precisely and automatically! Behind the innovative IMPRINT Sound processing is a key technology called MultEQ. It analyses the acoustic characteristics of your car interior, and then creates a set of equalisation filters to correct for frequency response and time delay problems for each speaker in your car. MultEQ applies processing to over 500 specific frequencies in the audio spectrum, correcting the sound to perfectly match your listening environment with incredible precision. The result is that everyone in the car hears the music with superb clarity and imaging. Processor for use with compatible 2008 head-units - CDA-9886R, CDA-9884R, iDA-X100, iVA-W505R * REQUIRES set up via KTX-H100 The Music You Expect to Hear You love music and you know good sound when you hear it. When you play your music on an audio system, you expect to be able to hear it with all the power, clarity and subtle expressive nuances of the original. Unfortunately, nothing dashes those expectations more thoroughly than the sonic environment of the car.  Poor Acoustics in the Car The car interior is full of materials that actively distort and degrade the sound. Windows amplify and reflect high frequencies. Seat and dashboard coverings change certain frequencies. Carpets absorb and suppress mid frequencies. These problems are far too complex to be solved by simple equalisation. In addition, since the speakers are located at different distances from the listeners, the sound stage created in the car is unbalanced and asymmetrical.

JL Audio's exclusive NexD switching technology achieves total amplifier efficiencies exceeding 80%, which means far less heat and less strain on your vehicle's electrical system than a conventional large amplifier. This efficiency advantage, combined with state-of-the-art microelectronic components allows us to use very compact unitary cast alloy heat sinks. As with their more expensive HD siblings, XD's also deploy JL's Advanced Thermal Rollback System to completely eliminate annoying thermal shut-down events.  Beneath every XD's removable control cover, you will find studio-grade signal processing with fully variable crossover filters. Also included are our noise-killing, highly flexible differential-balanced inputs with remote level control capabilities via the HD-RLC remote level control (optional).  Some might just see a small amplifier... But, for those who appreciate great audio, XD's reveal something huge. 75W RMS x 6 @ 4 ohms 200W RMS x 3 @ 4 ohms NexD Ultra-High Speed Class D Dimensions: 260 mm x 180 mm x 52 mm     Features Connections Inputs: For superior noise immunity, RCA jack inputs Speaker output connections:     Accept up to 8 AWG wire +12V and Ground connections:     Accept up to 4 AWG wire On-board Crossover State-variable 12dB/octave Butterworth with continuously variable cutoff frequency selection 50-500 Hz Configurable as Low-Pass or High-Pass Defeatable Power Output Rated Power 14.4 V Stereo: 75W RMS x 6 @ 4 ohms / 100W RMS x 6 @ 2 ohms Rated Power 14.4 V Bridged: 150W RMS x 3 @ 8 ohms / 200W RMS x 3 @ 4 ohms Rated Power 12.5 V Stereo: 60W RMS x 6 @ 4 ohms / 90W RMS x 6 @ 2 ohms Rated Power 12.5 V Bridged: 120W RMS x 3 @ 8 ohms / 180W RMS x 3 @ 4 ohms THD at Rated Power: Specifications S/N Ratio: &gt;104 dB referred to rated power (A-weighted, 20 Hz-20 kHz noise bandwidth) S/N Ratio: &gt;84 dB referred to 1W (A-weighted, 20 Hz-20 kHz noise bandwidth) Frequency Response: 12 Hz - 22 kHz (+0, -1dB) Damping Factor: &gt;150 @ 4 ohms per ch./ 50 Hz Damping Factor: &gt;75 @ 2 ohm per ch. / 50 Hz Input Range:     100mV - 4V RMS Dimensions (L x W x H): 10.23 in. x 7.09 in. x 2.05 in.

1931	Dension Gateway 500 (GW51MO2) iPod Control for Audi	329.99	Dension	GW51MO2	iPhone / iPod Integration iPhone/iPod OEM Audi	http://www.safensound.co.uk/densiondensiongateway500gw51mo2ipodcontrolforaudi-p-1931.html?utm_campaign=google-simple&amp;utm_medium=product_search&amp;utm_source=google-simple	http://www.safensound.co.uk/catalog/images/dension gateway 500.png	new	Description The Gateway 500, Dension's master Piece of In Car Entertainment. The Gateway 500 is a special piece of engineering that really highlights how much vehicle development and in car entertainment systems have improved over the past decade. The Gateway 500 is designed to work with fibre optic systems now available in the majority of prestige vehicles (Audi's, BMW's Mercedes &amp; Porsche ect). Unlike normal wiring, firbe optics sends light signals through thin glass fibres spanning the vehicle monitoring all car systems (not only entertainment), this increases the performance and allows for future enhancements of the factory systems. However due to this normal kits are not compatible with any vehicle that has D2B or MOST fibre optic systems Although the Dension Gateway 500 is designed primarly for the iPod, a large number of other devices are compatible with the system. USB memory sticks and Mass storage devices can be connected via the USB input &amp; any device with an AUX output can also be attached. Although it is the iPod compatibility that really sets the gateway 500 aside from the others. When connected the iPod functions are accessable safely through your vehicle steering controls and your music and video library can be accessed and played in perfect quality through the factory system. One of the best features of the Gateway 500 is the ability to upgrade the system in the form of &quot;addons&quot; or additional devices that allow the system to perform specific tasks. The BTA1500 bluetooth adapter allows you to make use of your phone whilst driving, auto muting the music system when the phone is in use. Another useful device is the AVR (which isn't released yet) however when released the AVR will allow videos stored on you iPod or USB device to be played on factory fitted screens (in the headrest for example). The greatest feature on the AVR is that it is capable of playing media from multisource's. So you might want to listen to your iPod in the front whist the kids watch they're favourite movie in the back. The Dension Gateway 500 is provided with all the necessary equipment to connect to the standard MOST fibre optic systems. This break through by dension is one of many on the way in the coming years that will allow you to integrate many other systems and devices into your vehicle seamlessly to make sure you stay ahead of the technology curve.

1937	Dension Gateway 500 (GW51MO2) iPod Control for Smart	313.03	Dension	GW51MO2	iPhone / iPod Integration iPhone/iPod OEM Smart	http://www.safensound.co.uk/densiondensiongateway500gw51mo2ipodcontrolforsmart-p-1937.html?utm_campaign=google-simple&amp;utm_medium=product_search&amp;utm_source=google-simple	http://www.safensound.co.uk/catalog/images/dension gateway 500.png	new	Description The Gateway 500, Dension's master Piece of In Car Entertainment. The Gateway 500 is a special piece of engineering that really highlights how much vehicle development and in car entertainment systems have improved over the past decade. The Gateway 500 is designed to work with fibre optic systems now available in the majority of prestige vehicles (Audi's, BMW's Mercedes &amp; Porsche ect). Unlike normal wiring, firbe optics sends light signals through thin glass fibres spanning the vehicle monitoring all car systems (not only entertainment), this increases the performance and allows for future enhancements of the factory systems. However due to this normal kits are not compatible with any vehicle that has D2B or MOST fibre optic systems Although the Dension Gateway 500 is designed primarly for the iPod, a large number of other devices are compatible with the system. USB memory sticks and Mass storage devices can be connected via the USB input &amp; any device with an AUX output can also be attached. Although it is the iPod compatibility that really sets the gateway 500 aside from the others. When connected the iPod functions are accessable safely through your vehicle steering controls and your music and video library can be accessed and played in perfect quality through the factory system. One of the best features of the Gateway 500 is the ability to upgrade the system in the form of &quot;addons&quot; or additional devices that allow the system to perform specific tasks. The BTA1500 bluetooth adapter allows you to make use of your phone whilst driving, auto muting the music system when the phone is in use. Another useful device is the AVR (which isn't released yet) however when released the AVR will allow videos stored on you iPod or USB device to be played on factory fitted screens (in the headrest for example). The greatest feature on the AVR is that it is capable of playing media from multisource's. So you might want to listen to your iPod in the front whist the kids watch they're favourite movie in the back. The Dension Gateway 500 is provided with all the necessary equipment to connect to the standard MOST fibre optic systems.

The new Dension Gateway Five kit installs via a hardwired connection to the vehicles CD changer port, so if offers a minimum of CD quality with the bonus of providing text information on the vehicles instrument cluster and stereo (where possible). You will need to purchase a separate cradle or lead with this product which is available from our  listings. The Dension Gateway Five is fully controllable from the stereo and steering wheel controls to select tracks, albums, artists or playlists and has the option to play music via USB and AUX (basically what the Gateway 300 currently offers). However the additional functions that come with the Dension Gateway Five Kit mean you'll also receive Bluetooth hands free connectivity through the vehicle stereo and speakers system. The additional Bluetooth Integration is provided through the Gateway Five menu system which allows your Phone book to synchronise with the stereos display when your phone is connected providing instant access to all of your contacts.  The system will also stream music via Bluetooth, so an iPod or USB stick is not needed. The Bluetooth chip in GWF1 is the CSR Blue Core 4 which marks a significant step forward from what was being used previously in BTA1500, with more reliability and wider phone compatibility. The Gateway Five fully integrates with the vehicles CAN Bus system. As your phonebook will be transfered to the Cars system, you will need certain hardware components in place to display the information.

1974	Alpine INE-S900R Sat Nav with Bluetooth DVD / MP3 / CD	899.95	Alpine	INE-S900R	Headunits Sat Nav built-in	http://www.safensound.co.uk/alpinealpineines900rsatnavwithbluetoothdvdmp3cd-p-1974.html?utm_campaign=google-simple&amp;utm_medium=product_search&amp;utm_source=google-simple	http://www.safensound.co.uk/catalog/images/ine-s900r.jpg	new	Description The INE-S900R has an interface that allows drivers to display two applications of their choice on the screen, so they can see exactly what they want, depending on the driving situation. This extremely easy to use interface offers the ability to combine Alpines advanced navigation features with Bluetooth phone use, rear camera views, and much more. One Look Navi One Look Navi is Alpines new all-in-one navigation solution featuring an interface that lets you choose exactly what you want to display, with full-screen or split-screen view. You see all your desired information at one glance. Navigation maps, music and video sources, phone and a clock, its right there when you want it.  Another great One Look Navi innovation is that you can always shift the side screen to the main screen. For example, put the navigation map on the main screen while driving in the city, then when youre on the motorway change your music source to the main screen or you can select an entirely different side screen at any time.  A great navigation system is only the beginning of what you get with One Look Navi. It keeps you entertained with a built-in DVD/CD player (MP3/DivX compatible), an AM/FM tuner, and a USB connection for iPod, iPhone or USB sticks. Plus you can add other Alpine options like a TV tuner or a USB video interface. Controlling all these sources is simple, thanks to the touch screen and the easy to use interface. One Look Operation You have a choice of a full screen or main and side screens. The dual-screen mode gives you two clear views with one look and is fully customisable, so you select what you want to see. You can also switch the two screens at any time depending on the driving situation, for example, whether you want the map on the main screen, side screen, or not at all. After you decide what you want on the main screen, you have numerous choices for the side screen. View the information for each iPod song that plays, see incoming phone calls automatically, keep a mini-map on the side, and more. Just choose the most useful combination. 1.) Radio, 2.) Navigation, 3.) iPod / CD, 4.) Phone, 5.) Clock, 6.) P0Is  Designed for Maximum iPod and iPhone Enjoyment In addition to enjoying your favourite music and podcasts, you can watch iPod and iPhone videos. Song selection and playback control are quick and easy, and you get all the track information plus a view of the album cover on your choice of full screen, main screen or side screen. You also get one look radio convenience. When you put the radio display on the main screen, you see the name of the station thats tuned in and the names of the preset stations, in addition to the frequencies. This makes selecting stations much easier, not only for you, but for other family members who may use the car. One Look Guidance Alpines latest navigation interface gives you more useful information at one look, with a main screen plus a side screen that provides many viewing options. Put a map with a zoomed-in view on the main screen for a close look at motorway exit numbers, one way streets and other details. Keep the usual low-zoom map on the side screen to get the big picture. The INE-S900R provides map software for 35 countries. The menu shows country flags and abbreviations, making selection easy. When selected, the country is indicated on the map.  Youll appreciate how quickly the navigation screen comes up after you power on the unit. Start-up is much quicker than other systems and route calculation is ultra fast: for example, for a 1600km route, calculation is done in only 6 seconds, as opposed to the common one minute for competitors.

1982	JL Audio Evolution C3-650 Convertible 6.5&quot; Speakers	281.72	JL audio	C3-650	Speakers Full Range Speakers 6 1/2" (17cm)	http://www.safensound.co.uk/jlaudiojlaudioevolutionc3650convertible65speakers-p-1982.html?utm_campaign=google-simple&amp;utm_medium=product_search&amp;utm_source=google-simple	http://www.safensound.co.uk/catalog/images/C3-650.jpg	new	Description There are times when an installation calls for a separate woofer and tweeter and other times when a coaxial is the better approach. With the new JL Audio Evolution&reg; C3 Convertible Component Systems, the same product can be deployed in either configuration, delivering outstanding audio quality in both. Creating this product required an entirely new woofer chassis design with carefully engineered architectural features. JL Audio's engineers specified an extremely strong, glass-filled polymer to form the new baskets via an injection molding process. This allows for even tighter mechanical tolerances than a cast alloy basket and also results in a low resonance, non-magnetic mounting structure. JL Audio's patented Elevated Frame Cooling technology is also built in to improve the woofers heat dissipation and power handling. Inside these new baskets is a potent woofer design using oversized (1.2-inch diameter) voice coils for enhanced power handling and reduced thermal compression. Long coil winding lengths create a very wide dynamic envelope in which linear behavior is maintained, reducing distortion and improving bass capability. C3 woofer cones are precisely shaped to control response and reduce undesirable breakup characteristics and employ high-grade butyl rubber surrounds and Conex&reg; spiders for years of reliable, high-fidelity performance. The C3 tweeter is a true, edge-driven 1-inch (25mm) silk dome that excels on or off axis and offers very smooth and flat frequency response to well beyond 20 kHz. Silk is an ideal tweeter diaphragm material thanks to its light weight, strength, inherently good damping characteristics and environmental stability. These benefits combine to deliver very good efficiency, smooth response and sparkling high frequency detail without the harshness common in many competitive products. Driving this silk dome is a powerful motor using high-temperature grade neodymium and ferroluid-cooling for superior efficiency and long-term fidelity. The tweeter is built onto a carrier that can be mounted with a simple twist into a flush or surface mount fixture (for separate mounting applications), or onto the woofer's pole piece, when used as a coaxial. When the tweeters are mounted separately, phase plugs are provided to mount onto the woofers. Since the tweeter's coaxial wiring connections are done from the front of the C3 woofer, it is possible to convert a C3 from one mode to another while the woofer is mounted in the car. Specifically-designed, true 2-way outboard crossovers with premium capacitors and inductors are included with each system. These include adjustments for coaxial or separate tweeter mounting, plus four adjustable tweeter levels. The C3-525 and C3-650 include front-loading protective grilles with black steel mesh and electroformed logo nameplates that can be positioned on the grilles or elsewhere in the vehicle, according to the needs of the installation.

SLI 2 and SLI 4, for 2 and 4 channels respectively, are equipped with automatic turn-on device (ART, Automatic Remote Turn-on) to make up for a lack of remote signal, which is getting more and more common with OEM head units, to turn on/off the other system electronics. For these interfaces the Connection designers especially developed an audio transformer equipped with a galvanic insulation system which keeps the grounds of the devices you have to connect separate in order to grant top level performances and very high disturbance rejection. The windings precise arrangement and the material accurate selection for the core ensured a linear and extended frequency response even on the band extreme values, besides obtaining a correct output impedance, required to drive any device with pre-amplified level input. The Connection creativity is not limited to technical design, it astonishes for its cosmetic design too. Hi-tech lines and refined materials make SLIs perfect.

If the Vehicle is illegally moved, a signal is sent to the SmarTrack Secure Operating Centre who will in turn call the owner to confirm a possible theft. If the theft is confirmed, SmarTrack can begin to track the Vehicle live.    The Smartrack Protector Pro is supplied with its own back up battery. If your battery is disconnected or runs low SmarTrack Protector Pro will call and alert you of this.    If your Vehicle is stolen, you will need to obtain an incident/crime number from your local Police and pass this to the 24hr SmarTrack Secure Operating Centre. SmarTrack will then establish the exact location of the stolen Vehicle using GPS technology and highly detailed mapping screens and liase with the Police, Security and Recovery services providing regular location updates as necessary until your Vehicle is located and recovered.   Once your Vehicle has been located, SmarTrack will arrange for a Security Guard to wait with it until recovery can be arranged. Unlike other tracking devices, SmarTrack can be transferred from one Vehicle to another by any SmarTrack approved engineer.
